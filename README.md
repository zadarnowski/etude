Etude is a monadic and purely-functional language for low-level compile-time
reprentation of imperative programming languages.

It originated from my PhD work, based on the administrative normal form
proposed by Sabry et. al. [Flanagan, C., A. Sabry, B. F. Duba and M. Felleisen,
The essence of compiling with continuations in: Proceedings ACM SIGPLAN 1993
Conf. on Programming Language Design and Implementation, PLDI’93 (1993),
pp. 237– 247.]
